Platform Event Monitor
=======
With the previous release of Salesforce, we introduced the Salesforce Enterprise Messaging Platform `EMP` and the events that run on it `Platform Events`. Unfortunately platform events are short lived (sub 24 hours) and are not logged anywhere in the Salesforce system unless strictly subscribed to. Thus not only is it hard to track these events but you also have no ability to debug if these events are coming to your org and hitting the various systems that digest the events. This unmanaged package exists to remedy some of those issues.

The unmanaged, when installed, offers a Visualforce page that allows you to create [APEX triggers](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_triggers.htm) on your [Platform Events](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.platform_events.meta/platform_events/platform_events_intro_emp.htm), a Custom Salesforce Object to track these Platform Events and an Einstein Analytics App with Einstein Analytics Dashboard in your org. It is recommended to create the Apex Triggers on *all* of your platform events and a Einstein Analytics App that lets you monitor the platform events and their count.

## Getting Started

This package is intended for admins who have access to Platform Events and Einstein Analytics.

### Prerequisites
```

- Platform Events
- Salesforce System Admin Access
- Wave Admin Access

### Setup Process

The org should be setup with Einstein Analytics. This means that the org has the necessary licenses and the feature is enabled in the setup tree. The user that is downloading the managed package should also have have the Einstein Analytics admin perms assigned to them so they can execute/load dataflows. In addition, the org has at least one Platform Events to create Apex Triggers on.

* You need to add your org's URL in the Remote Site Settings. To get the URL you need to use the Execute Anonymous in the developer console and grab the debug log after executing the following statement: System.debug(URL.getSalesforceBaseUrl().toExternalForm());
* This uses the URL class to get the base URL. After you grab the URL from the debug log, go to Setup and search for Remote Site Settings. On this page add your url as a remote site.
* Assign yourself the PlatformEventMonitorAdminUser permission set. Then assign the Integration User (w/ Analytics Cloud Integration User) the PlatformEventMonitorIntegrationUser permission set. Now make sure you can see the “CountPlatformEvents” and “CreateApexTriggers” tabs.
* After that go to the CreateApexTriggers tab, choose your platform events and then click on the 'Create Triggers' button. You should now automatically have ApexTriggers created for each of the org's platform events to monitor counts.

When completed the org should have an Einstein Analytics dashboard to centrally monitor all of your platform events.

Note: This doesn't count previously sent platform events and only captures platform events after the install of this package.
